<h1 style="color: pink">This Is My Experience</h1>
<p>After I finished my school studies, I am working as a cashier at the grocery store. As a cashier, I need to face the customers everyday. There are have many types of customers. For example, there are have customers who are always forgot to bring cash, the customers who are forgot to bring their own bag plastic because of during the weekdend the grocery did not provide the plastic bag, etc. Other than that, during semester break, I work as food delivery to my aunty. I help her to send the foods to the customers. Even though I did not have much experience, but I know how the feels in working environment, how to work as a team, and put high commitment in working.</p>
